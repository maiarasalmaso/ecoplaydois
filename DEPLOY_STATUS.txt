DEPLOYMENT STATUS: COMPLETED

Wait for Vercel rebuild (~2 minutes).

Changes Applied:
1. Admin Panel Simplified: No charts, no stars, only text comments grouped by user.
2. Deployment Fix: Removed exposed API key from `quiz.ts`.
3. Ambiguity Fix: Updated legacy `frontend/` folder code just in case Vercel builds from there.
4. Cleanup: Removed obsolete tests.

Next Steps:
- Check your live URL.
- If you still see the old version, force a rebuild in Vercel dashboard or clear browser cache.
