DEPLOYMENT STATUS: COMPLETED + THEME UPDATED

Wait for Vercel rebuild (~2 minutes).

New Changes:
1. **Theme Sync**: The Admin Panel now uses the main site's Teal/Green theme instead of the custom Orange one.
2. **Dark/Light Mode**: Fully supported using global CSS variables (`--theme-bg`, `--theme-text`, etc.).
3. **Consistency**: Buttons, inputs, and cards now match the rest of EcoPlay.

Next Steps:
- Check your live URL.
- Verify that the Admin Panel looks consistent with the home page in both Light and Dark modes.
